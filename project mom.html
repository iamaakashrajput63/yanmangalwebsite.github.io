Its objective is to explore Martian surface features, mineralogy, morphology and <br>atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments. A crucial objective of MOM was to develop<br> technologies required in planning, designing, management and operations of an <br>interplanetary mission.</p>

			<h1>Why did ISRO launch Mangalyaan on a PSLV rocket?</h1>
			<p>ISRO originally intended to launch Mangalyaan on <br>their Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket instead of the only roughly half<br> as powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). As with most Mars missions, a GSLV rocket<br> could’ve boosted Mangalyaan out of Earth orbit and onto an interplanetary trajectory to<br> the Red Planet. But the rocket suffered two failures in 2010, just as Mangalyaan was <br>being conceptualized.</p>

			<h1>Why is Mangalyaan in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars?</h1>
			<p>Mangalyaan entered Mars orbit with its closest point to<br> the planet at about 420 kilometers (about 261 miles) and farthest at about 80,000 <br>kilometers (about 49,710 miles), which is a much longer orbit than all its contemporary Mars<br> missions. Over the years, ISRO has reduced the orbit’s size but it hasn’t appreciably changed<br> relative to other missions. For example, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mapping mission<br> has a nearly circular orbit of about 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) while ESA’s Mars <br>Express has an orbit of 300 by 10,000 kilometers (about 186 by 6214 miles).</p>

			<h1>What is mangalyan in a Propellant Tank of Mask?</h1>
			<p>Rocket propellant tanks are pressure vessels where <br>liquid fuels are stored prior to use. They have to store the propellant, while minimizing slosh<br> and particularly when the tank is nearly empty, minimizing vortexing.Rocket propellant tanks<br> are often constructed of materials such as aluminium alloys, steels or carbon fibre<br> wound tanks.These kinds of tanks are usually constructed using monocoque construction techniques.<br> Balloon tanks are the most extreme of these, they are held rigid only by internal pressurization,<br> but are extremely lightweight. Rocket propellant tanks are of many shapes but <br>the optimum shape of a tank is spherical, because for given volume it results in a tank with least weight</p>

				<h1>What is mangalyan in a Microwave Radiometer?</h1>
				<p>A microwave radiometer (MWR) is a radiometer that <br>measures energy emitted at millimetre-to-centimetre wavelengths (frequencies of <br>1–1000 GHz) known as microwaves. Microwave radiometers are very sensitive receivers designed <br>to measure thermally-emitted electromagnetic radiation. They are usually equipped<br> with multiple receiving channels in order to derive the characteristic emission <br>spectrum of planetary atmospheres, surfaces or extraterrestrial objects. Microwave<br> radiometers are utilized in a variety of environmental and engineering applications,<br> including remote sensing, weather forecasting, climate monitoring, radio astronomy and<br> radio propagation studies.</p>

			<h2>What technologies did ISRO develop for Mangalyaan?</h2>
			<h1>Global view of Mars from MOM: Meridiani Planum</h1>
			<p>The fact that ISRO successfully placed a spacecraft in Mars orbit on their very first attempt garnered attention and praise from people <br>worldwide. In India, the mission had even deeper effects, aided by ISRO’s inaugural efforts to be active on social media to make people at large aware of the mission.</p>

				<h1>Geo Centric Phase</h1>
				<p>The spacecraft is injected into an Elliptic Parking Orbit by the launcher. With six main engine burns, the spacecraft is gradually maneuvered into a departure hyperbolic trajectory with which it escapes from the Earth’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) with Earth’s orbital velocity + V boost. The SOI of earth ends at 918347 km from the surface of the earth beyond which the perturbing force on the orbiter is mainly due to the Sun. One primary concern is how to get the spacecraft to Mars, on the least amount of fuel. ISRO uses a method of travel called a Hohmann Transfer Orbit – or a Minimum Energy Transfer Orbit – to send a spacecraft from Earth to Mars with the least amount of fuel possible.</p>

				<h1> Martian Phase</h1>
				<p>The spacecraft arrives at the Mars Sphere of Influence (around 573473 km from the surface of Mars) in a hyperbolic trajectory. At the time the spacecraft reaches the closest approach to Mars (Periapsis), it is captured into planned orbit around mars by imparting ∆V retro which is called the Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) manoeuvre. The Earth-Mars trajectory is shown in the above figure. ISRO plans to launch the Mars Orbiter Mission during the November 2013 window utilizing minimum energy transfer opportunity.</p>

				<p>The spacecraft leaves Earth in a direction tangential to Earth’s orbit and encounters Mars tangentially to its orbit. The flight path is roughly one half of an ellipse around sun. Eventually it will intersect the orbit of Mars at the exact moment when Mars is there too. This trajectory becomes possible with certain allowances when the relative position of Earth, Mars and Sun form an angle of approximately 44o. Such an arrangement recur periodically at intervals of about 780 days. Minimum energy opportunities for Earth-Mars occur in November 2013, January 2016, May2018 etc.</p>
